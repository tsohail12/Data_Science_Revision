🚀 Data Science Revision Series: Tackling Overfitting with Regularization 📉



Today's focus in my Data Science Revision Series was on Regularization Techniques for combating overfitting 
in linear regression. Here's what I explored:



🔍 Key Areas Covered:

1. Understanding Overfitting : Why it’s crucial to address this issue to ensure our models generalize well 
to unseen data.

2. Regularization Techniques:

  - Ridge Regression: Applied L2 regularization to shrink coefficients and reduce model complexity.

  - Lasso Regression: Used L1 regularization for feature selection and sparsity in the model.



3. Model Comparison:

  - Linear Regression: Compared with Ridge and Lasso to observe the impact of regularization.

  - Implementation: Built and evaluated models using both scikit-learn method for a comprehensive view.



🔬 Insights Gained:

Regularization helps to prevent overfitting by penalizing large coefficients, which in turn improves the model’s
performance on new, unseen data. Ridge and Lasso offer different benefits depending on the nature of your 
data and the problem at hand.



💡 Takeaway: Regularization is a powerful tool in the data scientist’s toolkit, enhancing model robustness and 
interpretability. Choosing the right technique can make a significant difference in model performance.
