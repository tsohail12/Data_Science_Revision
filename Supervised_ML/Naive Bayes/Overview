🔍 Data Science Revision Series: Naive Bayes



In today’s installment of my Data Science Revision Series, I’m diving into the practical application of the 
Naive Bayes algorithm for a loan prediction problem. Here’s a summary of the steps and findings:



🚀 Objective

To build and evaluate a predictive model for loan approval using Naive Bayes, while handling categorical data 
and ensuring robust predictions.



🔬 Data Preparation

Dataset: Loan prediction dataset including features such as 'Gender', 'Married', 'Dependents', 'Education', 
'Self_Employed', 'ApplicantIncome', 'LoanAmount', and more.

Preprocessing: Filled missing values, encoded categorical features using OneHotEncoder with 
`handle_unknown='ignore'` to manage unseen categories.



⚙️ Modeling

Algorithm: Gaussian Naive Bayes (replacing CategoricalNB due to handling issues with unseen categories).

Pipeline: Created a robust pipeline combining preprocessing with OneHotEncoding and the Gaussian Naive Bayes 
model.



📊 Results

Accuracy: Achieved 83.33% accuracy on the test set.

Classification Report: Evaluated precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.

Confusion Matrix: Visualized with a heatmap to understand the model’s performance.



📈 Insights

Using Gaussian Naive Bayes with OneHotEncoding provides flexibility and robustness when dealing with categorical 
features and unseen categories. The confusion matrix and classification report offer detailed insights into the 
model's strengths and areas for improvement.
