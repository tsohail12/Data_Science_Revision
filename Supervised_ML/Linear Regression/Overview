🚀 Data Science Revision Series: Linear Regression 📈

Exciting update from my Data Science Revision Series! Today, I delved into the fundamentals of Linear Regression, exploring how this powerful technique can be applied in real-world scenarios.

🔍 Key Steps Covered:
1. Data Cleaning: I started by removing outliers to ensure the accuracy and reliability of our model.
2. Model Building: I built Linear Regression models using two different approaches:
 - Scikit-learn: Leveraging this popular library for a streamlined and efficient model-building process.
 - Statsmodels OLS: Using the Ordinary Least Squares method for a deeper statistical analysis.

🔬 Why Two Approaches?
Both methods offer unique insights and tools. Scikit-learn provides a user-friendly interface and integration with other machine learning tools, while Statsmodels offers comprehensive statistical details and diagnostics.

💡 Takeaway: Removing outliers can significantly impact model performance. Understanding different libraries and approaches can enhance your analysis and help you choose the best tool for your needs.

Stay tuned for more updates as I continue this journey through data science concepts and techniques! 🚀📊
