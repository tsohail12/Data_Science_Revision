🚀 Data Science Revision Series: Decision Trees in Action 🌳

Today’s focus in my Data Science Revision Series was on the **Decision Tree** algorithm, a versatile and 
interpretable tool for both classification and regression tasks.

🔍 What I Did:
1. Learning Decision Trees: Explored how decision trees split data based on feature values to make predictions.
2. Machine Failure Dataset: Loaded a dataset containing sensor data to predict machine failure.
3. Data Exploration & Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the data to ensure high-quality inputs for the model.
4. Model Building:
   - Used GridSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters for the Decision Tree model.
   - Built the model using these optimal parameters and calculated its accuracy.
5. Visualization:
   - Visualized the Decision Tree, providing a clear, intuitive view of how the model makes decisions.

🔬 Takeaway: Decision Trees are powerful for their simplicity and interpretability. The visualization helps to 
easily understand the model’s decision-making process, making it a great tool for explaining results to 
non-technical stakeholders.

Stay tuned as I continue to explore and implement key machine learning algorithms in this series! 🚀📊
