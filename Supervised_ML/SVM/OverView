🚀 Data Science Revision Series: Exploring Support Vector Machines (SVM)🤖

Today’s journey in my Data Science Revision Series took me deep into the world of Support Vector Machines (SVM), 
a powerful algorithm for classification tasks.

🔍 Key Steps Covered:

1. Learning SVM: Delved into the theory behind SVM, understanding how it finds the optimal hyperplane to separate 
classes.

2. Data Exploration and Preprocessing: Loaded, cleaned, and prepared the dataset for modeling.

3. Dimensionality Reduction with PCA:

  - Applied PCA with 2 components and 3 components to reduce the dataset’s dimensionality while retaining maximum 
variance.

4. Model Building:

  - Built SVM models using both 2 and 3 principal components.

  - Evaluated and compared the models to see how dimensionality reduction impacts performance.

5. Hyperplane Visualization:

  - Visualized the decision boundary (hyperplane) for both models, gaining insights into how SVM separates the 
data in reduced dimensions.



🔬 Takeaway: Applying PCA before SVM can simplify the model while still capturing the essential patterns in the 
data. Visualizing the hyperplane in lower dimensions offers an intuitive understanding of how SVM makes decisions.
