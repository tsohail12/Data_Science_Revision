🚀 Data Science Revision Series: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm 🧠

In this session, we dove deep into the KNN algorithm and explored its practical application:

🔍 Key Highlights:

1. Outlier Removal: Cleaned our dataset to ensure accurate model performance by smoothing out the outliers.

2. Parameter Tuning: Delved into various parameters to find the optimal settings for our KNN model.

3. Influential Parameter Analysis: Identified which parameter had the most significant impact on model 
performance.

4. Model Evaluation: Tested our KNN model with new user input data to assess its accuracy and robustness.

The results? 🎯 We successfully fine-tuned our model and achieved impressive performance metrics. 

Stay tuned for more insights and techniques as we continue our data science journey!
