🔍 Data Science Revision Series: Random Forest 🌳

Continuing with my DataScience revision series, today I delved into one of the most powerful algorithms in regression tasks: the Random Forest Regressor.

Overview:
I worked with a housing price dataset, aiming to predict the `SalePrice` based on various features like lot size, 
neighborhood, and year built. Using a pipeline approach, I ensured efficient preprocessing and model building. 
The key steps included:
- Label Encoding** for categorical variables 🏷️
- Random Forest Regressor** with 100 estimators 🌲
- Evaluation Metrics: I focused on Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared (R²) to assess model performance.

Results:
- MSE: 📉 Highlighting the average squared difference between actual and predicted values.
- MAE: 🧮 Measuring the average magnitude of errors.
- R² Score: 📊 Providing insight into the proportion of variance explained by the model.

Additionally, I visualized the feature importances to understand which variables contributed the most to the 
predictions. This not only improved interpretability but also provided valuable insights into the dataset.

🎯 Takeaway: Random Forest proved to be a robust choice for regression, balancing accuracy and interpretability. 
I’m excited to apply these concepts to more complex datasets!

Stay tuned for the next part in the series as I continue revisiting key algorithms and methodologies! 🚀
